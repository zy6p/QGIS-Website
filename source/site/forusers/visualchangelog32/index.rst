General
-------

Feature: New zipped project file format .qgz is now the default format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QGZ was added as an optional format in 3.0.
Having this format as the default format will ease a lot the path to go to a container able to embed resources like SVG, offline data in GPKG, color ramps, plugins or scripts.

This feature was developed by `Nathan Woodrow <https://nathanw.net/>`__

User Interface
--------------

Feature: Layers panel: indicators for filtered map layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main window's layer tree view (ToC) gets support for indicators that are shown when a vector layer has a filter applied. This makes it easier for users to understand that they are looking at a subset of all data. Clicking the indicator's icon brings up query builder.

This adds a mini-framework for display of extra icons in layer tree views next to layer and group names. Tool tip text can be associated with indicators to give extra context for indicators. In addition, a signal gets emitted when user clicks indicators and custom actions can be defined. The idea is that indicators can be used in the future for a subtle reporting of various bits of information, for example:

-  map layer with invalid geometries
-  map layer with on-the-fly reprojection exceptions
-  map layer has missing data source
-  map layer with invalid CRS

Feature: Drill-down (cascading) forms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QGIS 3.2 introduces drill-down (cascading) form support, where the values available in one field depend on the values of other fields. This feature allows users to create âvalue-relationâ expressions based on the current value of another field in the same form. When the user modifies a fieldâs value, the choices available in all related fields are filtered to match the new value â allowing a hierarchical filtering strategy (drill-down, or cascading) inside a form.

Map Composer
------------

Feature: Data defined table source for attribute table items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an attribute table is set to a "Layer features" source, this new feature allows the underlying vector layer from which to source features to be data defined.

(All existing table attributes (column settings) are left intact, so setting a data defined table to a layer with different fields will result in empty columns in the table.)

This feature was funded by `Kartoza/InaSAFE <http://kartoza.com/en/>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Project metadata embedded in layout exports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature was developed by `Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting) <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk>`__

Feature: 'Project points (cartesian)' algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This new Processing algorithm projects points from an input point layer by a specified distance and bearing (azimuth). It supports dynamic parameters for the distance and bearing so that the distance and bearing can be taken from field values or expressions.

This feature was funded by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Dynamic parameter values for more algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

QGIS 3.2 extends the work begun in 3.0 to allow "dynamic" parameters for selected Processing algorithms. Dynamic parameters allow users to use expressions or field values to specify the value of a parameter while the algorithm executes, so e.g. the buffer size can be dynamically calculated for each individual feature buffered.

In 3.2 the following algorithms now support dynamic parameters:

-  Delete holes
-  Remove Duplicate Vertices
-  Simplify
-  Smooth
-  Snap to Grid
-  Subdivide
-  Transect
-  Translate

This feature was funded by `North Road <https://north-road.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Multi-ring buffer (constant distance) algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This new algorithm computes multi-ring ('donuts') buffer for all the features in an input layer, using a fixed or dynamic distance and rings number.

This feature was developed by Alex Bruy

Feature: New "segmentize" algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In QGIS 3.2 two new algorithms for segmentizing curved geometries have been added to Processing.

"Segmentize by maximum distance": The segmentization is performed by specifying the maximum allowed offset distance between the original curve and the segmentized representation.

"Segmentize by maximum angle": The segmentization is performed by specifying the maximum allowed radius angle between vertices on the straightened geometry (e.g the angle of the arc created from the original arc center to consective output vertices on the linearized geometry).

This feature was funded by `North Road <https://north-road.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Option to create points on all polygon parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Centroid" and "Point on surface" algorithms have a new option to create points for every individual part of input geometries.

This feature was developed by `Mathieu Pellerin <http://www.imhere-asia.com/>`__

Feature: Rotate Features algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This new algorithm allows rotation of features by a set angle. The rotation can occur around a preset point or each individual feature's centroid.

This feature was funded by `North Road <https://north-road.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Line sinuosity in "Add Geometry Attributes"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "Add Geometry Attributes" algorithm now calculates line sinuosity and straight distance for line layers.

This feature was funded by `North Road <https://north-road.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Import geotagged photos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In QGIS 3.2 a new "Import geotagged photos" algorithm has been added to Processing. It allows selection of a folder which it will scan for jpg files which have been geotagged and
creates a PointZ layer with the result, with attributes for photo path, altitude, direction and timestamp.

Optionally the scan can be recursive and you can create an optional table of photos which could not be read or which were missing geotags.

The algorithm automatically sets the output table to use an external resource widget to display the linked photos in the attribute form.

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Swap x/y coordinate values algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This algorithm swaps the X and Y coordinate values in input geometries. It can be used to repair geometries which have accidentally had their latitude and longitude values reversed.

This feature was funded by `North Road <https://north-road.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Sort order option for "Add Incremental Field"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This change allows users to optionally set a sort order to use when assigning values in the Add Incremental Field algorithm. Previously values were always added using the original feature order. With this change users can control the order in which features are assigned values.

This feature was funded by `North Road <https://north-road.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Indicator for distance parameter units
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an algorithm uses a "distance" type parameter, the units will now be shown next to the parameter. This avoids the confusion when running algorithms which use distances where the unit depends on a layer or CRS parameter - e.g. the distance parameter in the buffer algorithm gives the distance in layer units... so now in QGIS 3.2 we show those units
directly within the dialog. Hopefully this leads to less user confusion and accidental "1000 degree buffers"!

Additionally - if the unit is in degrees, a small warning icon is shown next to the parameter. The tooltip for this icon advises users to reproject data into a suitable projected local coordinate system.

This feature was funded by `North Road <https://north-road.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Algorithm log can be saved/cleared/copied
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the algorithm execution dialog, new buttons have been added to allow users to save the current log (to text or HTML files), copy the log contents to the clipboard, and clear the log.

This feature was funded by SMEC/SJ

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Wedge buffer algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This new algorithm creates wedge shaped buffers from input points.

The azimuth parameter gives the angle (in degrees) for the middle of the wedge to point. The buffer width (in degrees) is specified by the width parameter. Note that the wedge will extend to half of the angular width either side of the azimuth direction. The outer radius of the buffer is specified via outer radius, and optionally an inner radius can also be specified.

The algorithm supports dynamic parameters for azimuth, width, and radius.

The native output from this algorithm is CurvePolygon geometries, but these may be automatically segmentized to Polygons depending on the output format.

This feature was funded by `North Road <https://north-road.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Variable width buffers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Processing algorithms have been added to create variable width buffers, including tapered buffers (with a specified start and end diameter) and variable width buffers from line string m values.

This feature was funded by `North Road <https://north-road.com>`__

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Reclassify raster algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two new native QGIS raster reclassification algorithms have been added to Processing. These are simple to use, yet fast and stable, and work for ANY raster layer type supported by QGIS!

-  Reclassify by layer: reclassifies a raster using the ranges specified via min/max/value fields from a vector table

-  Reclassify by table: reclassifies a raster using a fixed table entered by users in the algorithm dialog

This feature was funded by SMEC/SJ

This feature was developed by `Nyall Dawson (North Road) <https://north-road.com>`__

Feature: Union algorithm with a single layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The union algorithm can be now run with just a single input layer in order to resolve any overlaps among the layer's features. For example, if an area is covered by three features, that area will be cut out from those features and three new features will be added, copying attributes of the original features.

Application and Project Options
-------------------------------

Feature: Mandatory layers in project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required layers are not allowed to be removed from the project. This adds extra safety to protect project users from removing layers they may think are not needed (e.g. used in joins, relations, expressions).

This feature was developed by `Martin Dobias (Lutra Consulting) <https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk>`__ and `Faunalia <https://www.faunalia.eu>`__

Feature: Saving and loading projects in PostgreSQL database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can now save their projects within a PostgreSQL database. Project can be saved in menu **Projects > Save To > PostgreSQL** and loaded using menu **Projects > Load From > PostgreSQL**. Projects saved in database can be loaded also through the browser dock (projects show up under the schema where they were saved, together with other layers).

Saving/loading QGIS projects must be explicitly enabled in PostgreSQL connection settings: there is a new option "Allow saving/loading QGIS projects in the database" which is disabled by default.

New API has been introduced that allows creation of custom project storage implementations (may be used by plugins). Related QEP: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/118

Feature: Project home path can be manually set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This new feature in QGIS 3.2 allows the project home path (which is used by the browser to create the 'Project Home' item) to be set by users for a project, instead of always matching the location where the project is saved.

This allows users to set the project home to a folder which contains data and other content, and is especially useful for organisations where QGIS projects are not stored in the root folder of a organisational 'project'.

Project home paths can also be set to relative paths, in which case they will be relative to the project saved location.

The path can be set through the Project Properties dialog, or by right-clicking on the Project Home browser item and selecting 'Set Project Home'.

Data Providers
--------------

Feature: Support for mesh layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initial work has been done to introduce mesh layers supporting display of data on structured or unstructured meshes (grids) in addition to raster and vector layers. This is still a work in progress, expected to be fully ready in QGIS 3.4. The work so far lead to creation of a new library MDAL for handling of different formats of mesh-based data and there are new APIs introduced under the hood, however the user interface is not implemented yet.

Feature: Automatically set default style for layers for ArcGIS Feature Server layers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When layers from a Feature Server are loaded into QGIS 3.2, they will automatically have the same style applied as has been specified for that layer on the server, matching the appearance of the layer when it is loaded into ArcGIS.

Feature: Faster Oracle queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain operations are greatly sped up for Oracle layers, e.g. case-insensitive value matches for features.

Feature: Restrict table list for a Oracle database connection to a preset schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This change allows a schema to be set in the connection properties for an Oracle database connection. If set, only tables within that schema will be scanned and listed for the connection.

Previously the option existed to restrict the scan to tables which belong to the user, but this option does not support the use case where a connection must access tables from a different
user, and the default "scan everything" setting is too expensive (since it often takes multiple minutes to perform, especially when geometryless tables are shown).

Feature: Read only support for curved Oracle geometries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously these geometries were silently discarded.

Plugins
-------

Feature: Adding query history in DB Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 3.2 it is possible to store SQL queries. The query history is available into the SQL Window tab of the DB Manager plugin.

3D Features
-----------

Feature: 3D Polygons: Optionally generate back faces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes datasets with 3D polygons do not have consistent ordering of vertices (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) and that caused sub-optimal results in the 3D view: either some polygons (walls) seem to be missing if back-face culling is enabled - or some polygons are shaded incorrectly if back-face culling is disabled. With the new option **Add back faces** enabled, the tessellator will generate triangles in both directions (front and back) which greatly improves the rendering quality for such datasets.

The only downside when using this option is that more graphical memory is used (double amount of vertex data). Make sure to set culling mode to "Back" when using this option, otherwise there would be no visible difference as the scene would still render polygons with incorrect shading.
