Annual reports
==============

Starting in 2017, coincident with the establishment of a formal legal entity
(Swiss "Verein"), we are publishing an annual report for the preceding year
highlighting key activities within the QGIS project.

Note that the report will contain some financial information which is also
available as a separate report in the finances section of this web site.
